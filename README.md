Employee Performance & Retention Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee performance and retention using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains demographic, work-related, and performance-related information about employees. The tasks involve applying at least two algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) for classification or regression problems.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

Employee_ID

Age

Department

Years of Experience

Monthly Working Hours

Training Hours per Year

Performance Rating (1–5)

Job Satisfaction Level (Low/Medium/High)

Promotion in Last 2 Years (Yes/No)

Attrition (Yes/No)

Target Variables

Attrition (Yes/No) → Classification Problem

Performance Rating (1–5) → Regression Problem

🛠️ Tasks
Task 1: Random Forest

Train a Random Forest model for:

Classification → Predict Attrition

Regression → Predict Performance Rating

Perform feature importance analysis.

Present results with Accuracy, Precision, Recall (for classification).

Task 2: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Implement an SVM classifier to predict Attrition.

Experiment with different kernels: Linear, Polynomial, RBF.

Compare performance across kernels using appropriate metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, etc.).

Task 3: XGBoost

Train an XGBoost model for Attrition prediction.

Perform hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.

Compare results (Accuracy, Training Time, Explainability) with Random Forest and SVM.

📈 Deliverables

You are required to submit the following:

Cleaned Dataset

Notebook / Script with implementation

Graphical Results (plots, confusion matrix, feature importance, etc.)

Insights & Observations from the models

🚀 Priority Work

You will be given priority if you complete more than the minimum tasks (e.g., using all three algorithms or adding extra analysis/visualizations).
